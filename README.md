# engr103project
This code is for the Oregon State ENGR103H Spring Final Project

It is a game that can be played on a CPX board. The code is uploaded through the Arduino IDE.

This is a reaction-time game in which you are tasked with doing certain things on the CPX board as fast as possible to maximize points.

---------------------------------------------------------

Rules:

1.) You start with 1500 points, and you lose a point with every 10 ms it takes for you to complete each task

2.) You will be given 3 simple tasks out of a pool of 4(tasks may be repeated)

3.) If you cheat, you WILL be penalized!

3.) There is a grace period at the beginning of each task, so you will be able to accomplish a maximum of 1500 points

At the end of the game, you will find your points total!
