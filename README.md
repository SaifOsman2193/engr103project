# engr103project
This code is for the Oregon State ENGR103H Spring Final Project

It is a game that can be played on a CPX board. The code is uploaded through the Arduino IDE.

This is a reaction-time game, where you are tasked to do certain things on the CPX board as fast as possible to maximize points.

---------------------------------------------------------

Rules:

1.) You start with 250 points, and you lose a point with every 10 ms it takes for you to complete each task

2.) You will be given 5 simple tasks out of a pool (tasks may be repeated)

3.) There is a grace period at the beginning of each task, so you will be able to accomplish the maximum of 250 points

At the end of the game, you will find out your points total!
